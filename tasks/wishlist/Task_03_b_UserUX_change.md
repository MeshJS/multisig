# Task 03b: Enhanced User Change Handling at Runtime

## 1. Task Overview
**Implement robust handling of user changes at runtime to create seamless transitions when users switch wallet accounts or experience account changes.**

### Problem Statement
- **Current Issues**: 
  - No proper handling when users switch wallet accounts at runtime
  - Application state becomes inconsistent when account changes occur
  - No detection or response to account change events
  - User data and session state are not properly managed during account switches
  - Application crashes or shows errors when account changes happen

- **Who is affected**: All users of the multisig wallet application, particularly those who:
  - Switch between multiple wallet accounts in the same session
  - Use wallets that support multiple accounts
  - Experience account changes due to wallet provider behavior
  - Work with different wallet addresses for different purposes

- **Current state vs. desired state**:
  - **Current**: No account change handling, inconsistent state, application errors
  - **Desired**: Proper account change detection, state management, seamless transitions

### Solution Overview
- **High-level approach**: Implement simple account change logic - if the changed user is a participant of the currently used multisig wallet, stay in the wallet and on the same page; otherwise, redirect to home screen
- **Key benefits**: 
  - Eliminate application crashes and errors during account changes
  - Provide clear, predictable behavior for users
  - Maintain security by ensuring users only access appropriate multisig wallets
  - Simple logic that's easy to understand and maintain

## 2. Requirements

### User Stories
```
As a user who switches to an account that's part of the current multisig wallet, I want to stay on the same page so that I can continue working without interruption.

As a user who switches to an account that's not part of the current multisig wallet, I want to be redirected to the home screen so that I can select an appropriate wallet.

As a user whose wallet provider changes accounts automatically, I want the application to check if I'm still authorized for the current wallet so that I don't see errors or unauthorized access.

As a user working with multiple multisig wallets, I want clear feedback when I switch accounts so that I understand why I'm staying or being redirected.
```

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-1: Account Change Detection**
  - Detect when wallet account changes occur at runtime
  - Listen for account change events from wallet providers
  - Identify when the current user address has changed
  - Handle both manual and automatic account switches

- **FR-2: Multisig Wallet Authorization Check**
  - Check if the changed user address is a participant of the current multisig wallet
  - Retrieve the current multisig wallet's participant addresses
  - Compare the new user address against the participant list
  - Determine if the user should stay or be redirected

- **FR-3: Navigation Logic**
  - If user is a participant: stay on current page and update user context
  - If user is not a participant: redirect to home screen
  - Provide clear feedback to user about the decision
  - Handle edge cases (no current wallet, invalid wallet state)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1: Reliability Requirements**
  - Application should never crash due to account changes
  - Account change detection should work consistently across all wallet providers
  - Authorization check should be fast and reliable
  - Navigation logic should handle all edge cases gracefully

- **NFR-2: Usability Requirements**
  - Account changes should be handled automatically without user intervention
  - Clear feedback should be provided when staying or redirecting
  - Navigation should be smooth and predictable
  - User should understand why they're staying or being redirected

- **NFR-3: Security Requirements**
  - Users should only access multisig wallets they're authorized for
  - Authorization check should be performed on every account change
  - No unauthorized access to multisig wallet data
  - Secure handling of participant address validation
