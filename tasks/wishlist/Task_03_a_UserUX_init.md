# Task 03: Enhanced Initial Wallet Connection Experience

## 1. Task Overview
**Improve the initial wallet connection experience to create a seamless, intuitive onboarding flow for new users of the multisig wallet application.**

### Problem Statement
- **Current Issues**:

- **Key benefits**: 
  - Improved user onboarding and retention
  - Reduced connection failures and support requests
  - Better accessibility and usability
  - Consistent experience across all wallet providers

## 2. Requirements

### User Stories
```
As a new user, I want to easily connect my wallet with clear instructions so that I can start using the multisig application without confusion.

As a returning user, I want my wallet to automatically reconnect so that I don't have to manually connect every time I visit the application.

As a user experiencing connection issues, I want clear feedback about what went wrong so that I can resolve the problem quickly.

As a user with multiple wallet providers, I want a consistent connection experience so that I don't have to learn different flows for each wallet.
