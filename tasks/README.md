3. **Reference requirements**: AI can read task files and provide context-aware suggestions

#### For VS Code Users
1. **Install markdown extensions**: Use "Markdown Preview Enhanced" for better task viewing
2. **Use TODO extensions**: Track requirements as TODOs in your code
3. **Workspace setup**: Configure workspace with tasks and code side-by-side

#### For Other IDEs
- **JetBrains**: Use built-in markdown preview and TODO tracking
- **Vim/Neovim**: Use markdown preview plugins and split windows
- **Any IDE**: Keep task files open in tabs or side panels while coding

### Task Template Usage

The `Task_template.md` provides a comprehensive structure for documenting:
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Technical Specifications**: API specs, database schema, integration points
- **Implementation Plan**: Development phases and dependencies
- **Testing Strategy**: Test cases and acceptance criteria
- **Code Analysis**: Key issues and implementation details

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Tasks Updated**: Update task documentation as requirements evolve
2. **Link Code to Tasks**: Use commit messages and code comments that reference task sections
3. **Version Control**: Commit task updates alongside related code changes
4. **AI Integration**: Leverage AI assistants to help implement task requirements
5. **Regular Reviews**: Review and update tasks during development sprints

### Integration with Development Tools

- **Git**: Link task sections to specific commits and pull requests
- **Project Management**: Create tickets based on task sections
- **Code Reviews**: Reference task requirements in review comments
- **Documentation**: Keep tasks as living documents that evolve with the project

This approach ensures that project requirements, technical specifications, and implementation details remain tightly coupled with the codebase, enabling more efficient and context-aware development workflows.

## How to Use the Tasks Directory

### Getting Started

# 2. Ask AI: "Based on Task_XX_FeatureName.md, how should I implement [specific requirement]?"
# 3. Use AI to generate code that addresses task requirements
# 4. Reference task sections in your prompts
```

**Example Cursor Prompts:**
- "Based on FR-1 in Task_01_Integration.md, generate the authentication service"
- "How should I implement the database schema described in Task_02_UserPage.md?"
- "Check if my implementation meets the requirements in section 3 of the task"

#### VS Code
```bash
# 1. Install extensions:
#    - Markdown Preview Enhanced
#    - TODO Tree
#    - GitLens (for linking commits to tasks)

# 2. Set up workspace with tasks and code side-by-side
# 3. Use TODO comments referencing task requirements
```

**Example VS Code Setup:**
```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "markdown.preview.breaks": true,
  "todo-tree.general.tags": ["FR-", "NFR-", "TC-"],
  "files.associations": {
    "Task_*.md": "markdown"
  }
}
```

#### JetBrains IDEs
```bash
# 1. Use built-in markdown preview
# 2. Set up TODO patterns for task requirements
# 3. Use the TODO tool window to track progress

```

### Task Management Best Practices

#### 1. **Task Lifecycle**
```
[Planning] → [In Progress] → [Review] → [Complete]
     ↓           ↓            ↓          ↓
  Create     Update        Validate   Archive
  Task       Progress      Against    Task
             Notes         Criteria   Notes
```

#### 2. **Progress Tracking**
```markdown
# In your task file, update status like this:
## Implementation Status
- [x] FR-1: User authentication (COMPLETED - 2024-01-15)
- [ ] FR-2: API integration (IN PROGRESS - 2024-01-16)
- [ ] FR-3: Frontend implementation (PENDING)
```

#### 3. **Code Integration**
```typescript
/**
 * Implements FR-1: User Authentication
 * Task: Task_01_Integration.md
 * Requirements: Functional Requirements section
 * Status: COMPLETED
 */
export class AuthService {
  // Implementation here
}
```

#### 4. **Commit Messages**
```bash
# Reference task sections in commits
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication (Task_01_Integration.md - FR-1)"
git commit -m "fix: resolve API integration issue (Task_01_Integration.md - Technical Specs)"
git commit -m "test: add test cases for user journey (Task_01_Integration.md - TC-1)"
```

### Collaboration Guidelines

#### 1. **Team Workflow**
- **Assign tasks** to team members with clear ownership
- **Review tasks** before starting implementation
- **Update progress** regularly in task files
- **Link pull requests** to specific task requirements

#### 2. **Code Reviews**
```markdown
# In PR descriptions, reference tasks:
## Changes Made
- Implements FR-1: User authentication (Task_01_Integration.md)
- Addresses NFR-2: Performance requirements (Task_01_Integration.md)
- Includes tests for TC-1, TC-2 (Task_01_Integration.md)

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests for authentication service
- [x] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Manual testing of user flows
```

#### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- **Keep tasks current** as requirements evolve
- **Add implementation notes** to task files
- **Document architectural decisions** made during development
- **Update acceptance criteria** based on new insights

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Q: How do I handle changing requirements?**
A: Update the task file with the new requirements and document the changes. Use version control to track requirement evolution.

**Q: What if a task is too large?**
A: Break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Create sub-tasks or split into multiple task files.

**Q: How do I link code to specific requirements?**
A: Use code comments, commit messages, and PR descriptions that reference task sections (e.g., "FR-1", "TC-2").

**Q: Can I use external project management tools too?**
A: Yes, but keep the tasks directory as the source of truth for technical requirements. Sync with external tools as needed.

### Advanced Usage

#### 1. **Automated Task Validation**
```bash
# Create scripts to validate implementation against tasks
# Example: Check if all FR-* requirements are implemented
grep -r "FR-" tasks/ | while read line; do
  echo "Checking requirement: $line"
  # Add validation logic here
done
```

#### 2. **Task Templates for Different Types**
- **Feature Tasks**: Use full template for new features
- **Bug Fix Tasks**: Simplified template focusing on problem/solution
- **Refactoring Tasks**: Template emphasizing code quality and architecture

#### 3. **Integration with CI/CD**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Validate Task Requirements
  run: |
    # Check if implemented features match task requirements
    # Validate that all FR-* items are addressed
    # Ensure tests cover TC-* items
```

This comprehensive usage guide ensures that developers can effectively leverage the co-located tasks directory for improved development workflows and better integration with AI-powered coding assistants.
